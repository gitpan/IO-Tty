2001-11-28   Roland Giersig  <rgiersig@cpan.org>

	* Tty.pm: v0.92_04

	* Tty.xs (BOOT): use perl_get_sv for backward compat

	* Makefile.PL: added analysis of configuration

2001-11-27   Roland Giersig  <rgiersig@cpan.org>

	* Tty.pm: v0.92_03

	* Tty.xs (BOOT): removed export_fail, undefined constants are now
	undef instead of not exportable; added CONFIG variable.

	* Makefile.PL: added setting of CONFIG var

	* test.pl: added printing of CONFIG var

	* Pty.pm (spawn): fixed bug with $^W handling

2001-11-17   Roland Giersig  <rgiersig@cpan.org>

	* Tty.xs (pty_allocate): complete rewrite, based on ideas from
	openssh and Xemacs.  Tries all ways detected by Makefile.PL in
	order, so in theory it should work everywhere (modulo system
	quirks).  First tries the high-level openpty() before getpt(),
	then various clone devices and finally BSD-style ptys.

	* Tty.xs (open_slave): moved master init stuff here, must be done
	before opening the slave.  The Stream module pushes are now tried
	on all systems but only generate warnings on systems that we know
	need them.

	* Makefile.PL: added tests for all kinds of functions and clone
	devices.
	
2001-11-14   Roland Giersig  <rgiersig@cpan.org>

	* Tty.xs (MODULE): stole creation code from openssh

	* test.pl: added test for controlling terminal

	* Pty.pm (spawn): rearranged setsid() and added a fresh open of
	the slave pty so the pty becomes the controlling terminal for the
	process.

2001-10-25   Roland Giersig  <rgiersig@cpan.org>

	* Pty.pm (spawn): copied spawning process from Tcl/Expect (thanks,
	  Don!); should set the controlling tty so ssh and other password
	  requesting programs should be OK; also now returns exec errors.
	  (slave_pid): added method to get at PID of spawned process.

	* Makefile.PL: added TIOCCONS.

	* try: adapted to use spawn().

	* test.pl: adapted to use spawn(); added test for exec errors.

2001-10-16  Roland Giersig  <rgiersig@cpan.org>

	* Pty.pm (new): fixed bad my() line

	* automatically add IO::Stty to ISA if it exists.

2001-07-16  Roland Giersig  <rgiersig@cpan.org>

	* test.pl: finally some tests!  Spawns a perl mini-script that
	  echoes back all characters from STDIN, but inverted.

	* Pty.pm (slave): slave now is set to be a controlling tty if possible;
	  it also remembers it's name now.

	* Makefile.PL: 
	  - on SCO, the slave pts* are in the /dev dir, not /dev/pts
	  - added test for libutil.h, util.h, pty.h and openpty()
	  - added symbol TIOCSCTTY

	* Tty.xs:
	  - some SVR4 only define __SVR4; fixed.
	  - OSF machines need termio.h for various macros
	  - AIX doesn't define VOIDSIG; fixed.
	  - Cygwin can use /dev/ptmx even though that file doesn't exist.
	  - added openpty() version for FreeBSD and others that have 
	    no good method for creating ptys; untested.

	* Tty.pm:
	  - moved docu over from Pty.pm to lessen confusion Pty <-> Tty
	  - added verified systems list
