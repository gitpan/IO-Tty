	* test.pl: finally some tests!  Spawns a perl mini-script that
	  echoes back all characters from STDIN, but inverted.

	* Pty.pm (slave): slave now is set to be a controlling tty if possible;
	  it also remembers it's name now.

	* Makefile.PL: 
	  - on SCO, the slave pts* are in the /dev dir, not /dev/pts
	  - added test for libutil.h, util.h, pty.h and openpty()
	  - added symbol TIOCSCTTY

	* Tty.xs:
	  - some SVR4 only define __SVR4; fixed.
	  - OSF machines need termio.h for various macros
	  - AIX doesn't define VOIDSIG; fixed.
	  - Cygwin can use /dev/ptmx even though that file doesn't exist.
	  - added openpty() version for FreeBSD and others that have 
	    no good method for creating ptys; untested.

	* Tty.pm:
	  - moved docu over from Pty.pm to lessen confusion Pty <-> Tty
	  - added verified systems list
