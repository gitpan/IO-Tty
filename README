IO::Tty and IO::Pty provide an interface to pseudo tty's

To build this distribution run

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

There is finally a 'make test' for this distribution!!
For manual tests there is still a script included called 'try'.

If try is run with arguments it will run then as a command with the
output connected via a pseudo tty, eg

   perl -Mblib try ls

This module was developed by Graham Barr <gbarr@pobox.com>
and is now maintained by Roland Giersig <RGiersig@cpan.org>.

GREAT NEWS!!  It now works on Windows under Cygwin
(http://source.redhat.com/cygwin) !!  For all those interested: Cygwin
provides /dev/ptmx semantics, but there is no actual file called
'/dev/ptmx'.  Still, when someone opens it, Cygwin emulates the Right
Thing (tm).  Deep Magic!

It should finally work with HPUX 11.0 and FreeBSD, but I cannot do any
in-depth testing, so please provide feedback.

Please note that pty creation is very system-dependend.  If you have
problems on your system, please send me (<RGiersig@cpan.org>) the output 
of a manual installation ('perl Makefile.PL; make; make test;') and 
I'll see what I can deduce from it.

Supported systems include Linux, Solaris, AIX, OSF, *BSD, HP-UX and
finally Windows (under the Cygwin environment, see
http://source.redhat.com/cygwin).  See the IO::Tty manpage for a list.
If it's working on your system, please send me a short note with
details (version number, distribution, etc. 'uname -a' is a good
start) so I can get an overview.  Thanks!

As this module is mainly used by Expect, support for it is available 
via the two Expect mailing lists, expectperl-announce and
expectperl-discuss, at

  http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/expectperl-announce

and
