IO::Tty and IO::Pty provide an interface to pseudo tty's

To build this distribution run

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

ALL BRAND NEW!!

I finally took the time to give the pty-allocation part a complete
overhaul.  Thanks to openssh and Xemacs teams for providing me with a
lot of inspiration through their own pty-allocation codes.

I also used a few ideas in the spawn code of Tcl/Expect (thanks,
Don!), so stability should be vastly improved, especially with
spawning ssh and friends (no "no controlling terminal" error any
more).

Please note that pty creation is very system-dependend.  I am
beginning to get an overview, but there are a *lot* of different
systems out there.  If you have problems on your system, please send
me (<RGiersig@cpan.org>) the output of a manual installation ('perl
Makefile.PL; make; make test;') and I'll see what I can deduce from
it.

Supported systems include Linux, Solaris, AIX, OSF, *BSD, HP-UX and
finally Windows (under the Cygwin environment, see
http://source.redhat.com/cygwin).  See the IO::Tty manpage for a list.
If it's working on your system, please send me a short note with
details (version number, distribution, etc. 'uname -a' is a good
start) so I can get an overview.  Thanks!

Note that the cygwin ptys have problems when you feed them too much
in one swoop.

See the ChangeLog and the docs for details.
