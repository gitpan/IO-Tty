IO::Tty and IO::Pty provide an interface to pseudo tty's

To build this distribution, run

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

This (v1.03) is a small bugfix-release. I fixed an issue with 
newCONSTSUB, so the IO::Tty::Constants now work as designed: 
they all exist but are undef if not implemented on your system, 
so you can wrap ioctl with an 'if (defined CONSTANT)'. This
means that warnings about bad ioctl should be gone.

I was not able to check this fix on perl versions older than 
5.8 so there might be issues with them. 

Please note that pty creation is very system-dependend, and there 
are a *lot* of different systems out there.  If you have problems 
on your system, please send me (<RGiersig@cpan.org>) the output 
of a manual installation ('perl Makefile.PL; make; make test;') 
and I'll see what I can deduce from it.

Supported systems include Linux, Solaris, AIX, OSF, *BSD, IRIX, HP-UX
and finally Windows (under the Cygwin environment, see
http://www.cygwin.com/).  See the IO::Tty manpage for a
detailed list.  

Sorry, ActiveState Perl on Windows is not supported, basically 
because there are no pseudo-terminals under Windows. 

If it's working on your system, please send me a short note with
details (version number, distribution, etc. 'uname -a' is a good
start) so I can get an overview.  Thanks!

See the ChangeLog and the docs for details.

Oh, and many thanks to all testers, without their support this project
would still be limited to a few systems that I have access to.  Thanks
also to SourceForge (http://sf.net) who is hosting this and many other
projects, their services have made development and support a real
pleasure.  If you intend to donate something to the Open Source cause,
think about lending them a machine for their compile farm!
